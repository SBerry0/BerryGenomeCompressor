| Nov. 12 |  9:25-9:55am  | I made my first attempts at what I'm going to do for compression. My idea is to use only two bytes instead of all 8 for a character which would reduce the size. Right now the thing is kinda bugging out where it's saying that GenomeCompressor is a duplicate class... so idk we'll figure it out. |
| Nov. 12 | 10:10-10:25am |    I found out the reason it was all bugging out was because of an extra bracket. So I deleted that and finished up that last few things I needed to do. It almost works, the compression just seems to drop the last 3 characters. It might have something to do with bits being left in the buffer. |
