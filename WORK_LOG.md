My idea is to use only two bytes instead of all 8 for a character which would reduce the size. Right now the thing is kinda bugging out where it's saying that GenomeCompressor is a duplicate class... so idk we'll figure it out. |

So I deleted that and finished up that last few things I needed to do. It almost works, the compression just seems to drop the last 3 characters. It might have something to do with bits being left in the buffer. |
| Nov. 12 |  6:30-7:15pm  | I realized the extra bits was because the close method filled in the rest of the file with falses, which was read as an 'A'. So, I realized I had to somehow only read the length of the bits that were important and no more. I thought of making a marker indicator that would indicate when the word was ended, but then I realized that would require me to give an extra bit to each letter, so that would greatly increase the size. I opted to instead store the length of the string as the first part of the binary file that would be read, and then used to decompress the rest of it. I chose to make it 16 bits because I didn't need any negative values and 16 bits would suffice, even for a string as large as virus. This all works very well, with the compression ratio of the genomeTest at 33% and the compression ratio of the virus at 25%. |

So now everything it pretty much the same as last commit, except comments and using readShort() instead of read with a bit length of 16. |
